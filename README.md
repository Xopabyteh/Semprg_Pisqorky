## Semprg_Pisqorky
The game engine project. It offers a very flexible structure
thanks to the concepts introduced by oop.

Here you can implement stuff such as:
- custom strategies
- custom gamemodes
- custom boards with custom tiles
- custom drawing/rendering methods

There are currently theese gamemodes:
- ### Traditonal game
Game supports multiple players; Each player gets their turn, 
they start in a random order. The game gathers a player move
generated by a players strategy, the move is then validated and played.
If a move is considered illegal, the player gets **disqualified**.
- ### Swap game
**Can only be played in 2 players.** A Swap game is an
extension to the traditional game. The game starts with one player
choosing 3 pieces, 2 of his and 1 opponents. The second player then
gets to choose wether he wants the 2 pieces and go second or the 1 piece
and go first. The game then continues as a normal traditional game.

## Semprg_Pisqorky_Statistics
An additional project that offers an easy way to start a game
and summarizes the *quite basic* game results/statistics  for you.
